# BaladTest
A simple android endless list test project using MVVM Dagger2 Retrofit2 RXJava2 DiffUtil PagedList Navigation
It uses database as single source of trust
It also follows Clean Architecture approach as much as possible (but not fully)

Good news is:
    Publish PagedList.BoundaryCallback api calls error to upper layers handled perfectly using rxjava
    End list Porgressbar added to PagedListAdapter
