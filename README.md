# BaladTest
A simple android endless list test project using MVVM Dagger2 Retrofit2 RXJava2 DiffUtil PagedList Navigation

It uses database as single source of trust

It also follows Clean Architecture approach as much as possible (but not fully)

Good news is:

    1)Publish PagedList.BoundaryCallback api calls error to upper layers handled perfectly using rxjava
    2)End list Porgressbar added to PagedListAdapter

Note:

    1)I hard coded location ""40.7243,-74.0018" to get a longer list from server, you can uncomment this part and app will show you a list based on your location
